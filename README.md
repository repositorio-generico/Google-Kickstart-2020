# About
My solutions from the rounds of [Google Kickstart][1].

# A bit more
If someone reads this repo and considers it could be improved to be better understood, please send me a issue report.

If I achieve to solve all of them, I will start adding the tables to describe difficulty and what topics are involved in each problem.
Even if there is an analysis in each problem, when one wants to try each problem by themselves, one need just a hint and maybe it's 
better to have the structures or algorithms used instead of the analysis.
